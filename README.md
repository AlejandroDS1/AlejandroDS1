## Hi 👋 I'm Alejandro

🎓 Computer Science graduate from the University of Barcelona  
🛠️ Systems-oriented developer with a strong interest in low-level software, Linux, and infrastructure

I enjoy understanding **how systems really work**: operating systems, networking, storage, processes, and automation.  
More than just coding applications, I like building, customizing, and maintaining the software that *keeps systems running*.

On this GitHub you'll find:
- System-level projects
- Backend and infrastructure-related code
- Experiments focused on learning how things work under the hood

### 🔧 Technologies & Languages

I regularly work with:

- **Bash** (automation, scripting, system tooling)
- **Python** (APIs, tooling, backend services)
- **C / C++** (low-level programming, performance-oriented code)
- **Java** (academic and backend projects)

And I work mainly on **Linux-based environments**.

### 🧠 Areas of Interest

- Linux & Operating Systems
- System administration
- DevOps & infrastructure
- Networking fundamentals
- Cybersecurity (especially system-level security)

I’m especially interested in roles where I can combine **systems knowledge + programming**, such as:
- Junior Sysadmin
- DevOps / Platform Engineer
- Infrastructure or Security-related roles

---

### 🌍 Open Source & Collaboration

I’m actively looking to:
- Contribute to Open Source projects
- Learn from real-world codebases
- Collaborate with engineers who care about clean, reliable systems

If you think my profile fits your project or team, feel free to reach out!
